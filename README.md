ðŸ›’ Amazon Clone â€“ HTML & CSS Project
This is a static Amazon Clone website that I built during my first year of college. It was one of my initial projects, created to strengthen my understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals. The project replicates the basic layout and appearance of Amazon's homepage, including key UI elements such as:

Header with logo, search bar, and navigation links

Product sections with images, titles, and prices

Footer with multiple columns of links

The entire project is built without using any frameworks or JavaScript. It is focused purely on HTML for structure and CSS for styling. While it is not responsive and intended for desktop view only, it helped me grasp how real-world e-commerce websites structure their content and use CSS to style complex layouts.
